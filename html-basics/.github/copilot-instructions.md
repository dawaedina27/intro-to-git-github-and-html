# AI Coding Agent Instructions

## Project Overview
This project is an introduction to HTML basics. It currently contains a single file, `index.html`, which serves as the foundation for learning and practicing fundamental HTML concepts. The project is designed to be simple and self-contained, focusing on static web content.

## Key Files
- `index.html`: The main HTML file. It contains the structure and content of the webpage. This file is the primary focus for any updates or enhancements.

## Development Guidelines

### HTML Structure
- Follow semantic HTML practices. Use appropriate tags like `<header>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`, `<section>`, and `<article>` to organize content meaningfully.
- Ensure proper nesting of elements to maintain a valid DOM structure.
- Use comments (`<!-- -->`) to explain non-obvious sections of the code.

### Styling
- Inline styles should be avoided. If styling is required, consider linking an external CSS file or using `<style>` tags within the `<head>` section.

### Accessibility
- Add `alt` attributes to all `<img>` tags for accessibility.
- Use ARIA roles only when necessary to enhance accessibility for assistive technologies.

### Best Practices
- Indent nested elements consistently (2 spaces per level).
- Close all tags properly, even if optional (e.g., `<li>`, `<p>`).
- Use lowercase for all tag and attribute names.
- Include a `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration at the top of the file.

## Suggestions for AI Agents
- When adding new sections to `index.html`, ensure they align with the existing structure and style.
- Validate the HTML file using tools like [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) to ensure compliance with web standards.
- If creating additional files (e.g., CSS or JavaScript), place them in appropriately named directories (e.g., `css/`, `js/`) and link them correctly in `index.html`.

## Future Enhancements
- Consider adding a `README.md` file to document the purpose and usage of the project.
- Expand the project to include examples of CSS and JavaScript integration.
